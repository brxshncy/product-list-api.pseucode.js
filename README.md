# Toy Supplier API Middleware (Pseudocode)

This project is a pseudocode representation of a backend API middleware that interacts with 3rd party toy suppliers' APIs, standardizes the data format, and provides a unified interface for frontend web applications. Please note that the code provided here is not functional and serves as a conceptual outline for the project's architecture and functionality.

## Features

- **Dynamic Supplier Registration**: Pseudocode demonstrates the ability to register new toy suppliers with their respective API formats (SOAP XML, JSON, CSV) and endpoints.
- **Data Normalization**: Conceptual normalization of product data from different suppliers' APIs into a consistent JSON format.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilization of asynchronous operations for non-blocking communication with suppliers' APIs (demonstrated in pseudocode).
- **Error Handling**: Pseudocode includes robust error handling to gracefully manage exceptions during data fetching and normalization.
- **Scalability**: Pseudocode outlines a scalable architecture to integrate new suppliers and expand the functionality of the application.

## Usage

As this project is pseudocode, it cannot be executed. However, you can use the provided pseudocode as a reference to implement the actual functionality in your preferred programming language and framework.
